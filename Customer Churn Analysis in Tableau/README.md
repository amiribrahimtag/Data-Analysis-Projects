# Customer Churn Analysis Presentation in Tableau

**There's a reason why top analysts prefer Tableau stories over PowerPoint presentations.
The major reason is its inter-activeness and ease of data storytelling through already created visualizations.
But what if we can present static slides side by side interactive dashboards !! :O that's my goal through this project**

**I am glad to share my first Tableau Presentation :)
Report details are self explanatory on the story points and am looking forward any kind of advice and questions for sure.**
